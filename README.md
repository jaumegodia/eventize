# eventize

Convert objects into event emitters, that emit events before and after calling the specified methods.

## Installation

### Node 

Dependencies:

* node >= 0.10
* npm >= 2.0.0

```bash
npm install eventize
```

### Browser

The package is also available as a UMD module (compatible with AMD, CommonJS and exposing a global variable `eventize`) in `dist/eventize.js` and `dist/eventize.min.js` (1.9 KB minified and gzipped).

It can be installed with npm, bower or downloading the release from GitHub:

```bash
npm install eventize
bower install eventize
```

## Usage

### eventize.object

`eventize.object` converts plain objects into event emitters (if it they are not) and wraps the specified methods to emit events before and after being called:

```javascript
var eventize = require('eventize');

var myObject = {
  name: 'John',
  getName: function() {
    return this.name;
  },
  setName: function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    return name;
  }
};

// equivalent to eventize.object(myObject, ['setName']);
eventize.object(myObject, ['setName']);

myObject.on('setName:before', function(args, method, target) {});
myObject.on('setName', function(args, returnValue, method, target) {});

myObject.setName('Jack'); // emits setName:before and setName
```

### eventize.methods

`eventize.methods` wraps the specified methods to emit events before and after being called (the target must be an event emitter):

```javascript
var eventize = require('eventize');
var util = require('util');
var EventEmitter = require('util');

function MyConstructor() {
  EventEmitter.call(this);
}

util.inherits(MyConstructor, EventEmitter);

MyConstructor.prototype.addOne = function(value) {
  return value + 1;
};

eventize.methods(MyConstructor.prototype, ['addOne']);

var myObject = new MyConstructor();
myObject.on('addOne:before', function(args, method, target) {});
myObject.on('addOne', function(args, returnValue, method, target) {});
myObject.addOne(1); // Emits addOne:before and addOne
```

### eventize.method

`eventize.method` wraps a single method to emit events (the target must be an event emitter):

```javascript
eventize.method(myObject, 'getName');
myObject.on('getName:before', function(args,  method, target) {});
myObject.on('getName', function(args, returnValue, method, target) {});
myObject.getName(); // emits setName:before and setName
```

## Tests

To run the tests with Jasmine:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
